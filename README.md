# Rclipper

Rclipper is a polygon clipping tool implemented in pure ruby. The algorithm is based on "Efficient clipping of arbitrary polygons by GÃ¼nther Greiner and Kai Hormann". Degeneracy fix by Erich L Foster and James Overfelt. Also thanks to Helder Correia (https://github.com/helderco/univ-polyclip)
